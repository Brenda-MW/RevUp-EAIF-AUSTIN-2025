# Rev it up: Deploy Tiny Neural Network to Boost Embedded Field-Oriented Controls of Electrical Drives with MATLAB and ST Edge AI Developer Cloud

In the realm of motor electrification, integrating Edge AI with Field Oriented Control (FOC) for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) offers a transformative opportunity to enhance speed performance, accuracy, and energy efficiency. This integration poses unique challenges due to the entrenched nature of traditional control techniques.

This hands-on workshop focuses on designing, optimizing and deploying Tiny Neural Network (TinyNN) to address the limitations of classic Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. Participants will explore methodologies for data collection, AI algorithm development and compression, leveraging the compact and efficient capabilities of TinyNN. By utilizing the combined tools and methodologies of MathWorks and STMicroelectronics, attendees will learn how to simplify the deployment of AI models to microcontroller units (MCUs). Through practical exercises, participants will gain insights into crafting small, efficient network architectures that can perform complex control tasks with minimal computational resources. The workshop will cover the entire workflow—from data processing and model training to code generation and deployment optimization—equipping attendees with the skills to innovate in embedded motor control using edge AI technology.
